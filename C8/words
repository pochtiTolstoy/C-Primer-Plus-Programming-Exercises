// Write a program that reads input as a stream of characters until encoutering EOF. Have
// it report the average number of letters per word. Don't count whitespace as being letters
// in a word. Actually, punctuation shouldn't be counted either, but don't worry about that
// now. (If you do want to worry about it, consider using the ispunct() function from the
// ctype.h family.)
